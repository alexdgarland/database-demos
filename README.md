Database Demos
==============

Code examples, slides etc. for my presentation <b>"Not Only SQL - Picking A Database For .NET"</b>, which explores the theory and practice of using various relational and NoSQL options for data persistence, with a focus on the point-of-view of developers using C# and related Microsoft technologues.

The talk was first delivered at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Leeds-Sharp/events/219714905/">the "Leeds Sharp" .NET User Group at Callcredit, Leeds on Thursday, April 30th 2015</a>.  Thanks to the organisers for inviting me and for continuing to support great sessions for the Yorkshire tech community.

I'm also using this repository for related experiments with NoSQL technologies which may make their way into later versions of the presentation!
